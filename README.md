# Visualization_CPP
A series of visualization projects done using [VTK](https://vtk.org/). The framework of this code was written by Prof Hank Childs. I completed the algorithms, implementing design taught in class. These projects are here as a basic demonstration of competency in both algorithm design / implementation, and basic C++ use.
